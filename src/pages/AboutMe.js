      <h2>The Long Story</h2>
        <h4>Early Days</h4>
      <div className="stories">
        <p >Born in Los Angeles, raised all over Southern California. I went to a different high school, in a different county, for each year. At the time, my dad was moving a lot for his job and that was my experience. I wasn't too thrilled, but looking back, I realized I knew a lot more people in different cities which is kinda cool. Graduating from High School in 2009 (yikes that makes me feel old) jobs were scarce and I wasn't sure about college. Thus, I began looking into the military and I joined the Army as an Infantryman in 2010.</p>

        <h4>Army</h4>
      <div className="stories">
        <p >As Private Martinez, I went to Ft.Benning in Georgia to complete One Station Unit Training. From there, I was assigned to 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division in Ft.Carson, Colorado. Six months after arriving there, we were deployed to Afghanistan for a year. I was also deployed to Jordan for 9 months during my time with 2BCT/4ID. During that time, I reenlisted and was relocated to Germany. From there, I participated in a few international training missions with military personnel from Germany, Romania, Finland, England and Latvia. I received my Honorable Discharge in early 2018.</p>

        <h4>College</h4>
      <div className="stories">
        <p>Freshly out of the military, I began looking into college. I enrolled at San Bernardino Community College and began classes in March. I began to notice that some of my experience in the Army was helpful in my studies and I really enjoyed my time there. I earned my Associate's in Business Administration in December of 2020.</p>
